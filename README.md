## Overview
The Age Calculator is a web app where users input their Date of Birth and the app calculates 
their age and outputs it. It lets users know the number of years, months and days old 
they are.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process
- I wrote my HTML first
- Then I styled it from top down using CSS
- Next with JavaScript I ensure only correct input are accepted
- Then the age is calculated and outputed.
- Finally animation was added to make the app look cool

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned more about the Date() funtion in JavaScript

### Continued development

Would love to try Mobile_First workflow
